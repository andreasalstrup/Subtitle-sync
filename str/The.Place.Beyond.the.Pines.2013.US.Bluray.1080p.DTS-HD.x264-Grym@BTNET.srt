718
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,507

I do have an education like this

when I was a kid,</i>

1310
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:35,301
<i>I used to look at my dad
dressed in judge's robes</i>

1311
01:32:35,426 --> 01:32:38,930
<i>and I used to think that
my father was a superhero.</i>

1312
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,933
<i>And I don't think
I was far off.</i>

1313
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:45,436
He had that quality
that judges have

1314
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:48,648
where they have
tremendous compassion,

1315
01:32:48,773 --> 01:32:51,943
but they're also
ferocious at the same time.

1316
01:32:52,026 --> 01:32:54,028
He wasn't afraid
of making enemies.

1317
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:57,573
I think that's probably
why he had so many friends.

1318
01:32:57,657 --> 01:32:59,951
I had the chance, right before he
fell into the coma, to tell him

1319
01:33:00,034 --> 01:33:03,412
that I was dedicating my run
for Attorney General to him.

1320
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:05,498
And... <font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>

1321
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:10,169
He shook his head, "No,"
and I didn't understand why.

1322
01:33:12,129 --> 01:33:14,590
So I leaned in close, and...
He could whisper.

1323
01:33:14,674 --> 01:33:16,550
And he said to me,

1324
01:33:16,634 --> 01:33:19,053
"I'll take the win, not the
run." <font color="#D900D9">(FAINT LAUGHTER)</font>

he doesn't come and live with you,

1339
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,236
he's gonna completely
go off the rails.

with the campaign and everything,
it's just not an ideal time.

1342
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:25,703
I mean, what am I gonna do with him?
I don't know what he likes.

1343

be good for him or anybody.

Okay.

No, well,
you can tell him that.
